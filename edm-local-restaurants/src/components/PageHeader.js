          <p>Hello friends,</p>
          <p>
            As y'all probably know, the COVID19 crisis is hitting everyone hard, especially small businesses.
            A lot of restaurants/food services are switching to takeout/delivery only, or closing. It'd be
            pretty sick if we could support them, so I've started a crowdsourcing spreadsheet for all the
            Asian restaurants/businesses in Edmonton that are open for pickup or takeout üòÅ that everyone can
            use, or contribute to. I'd be pretty sad if all my fav places were closed in 2 months, so pls help
            a girl out and try to prevent that from happening.
          </p>
          <p>Click on the pins or on a row in the table to get started!</p>

            You can drag the blue marker below to find nearby restaurants. You can also use the "My Location
            button" on compatible devices to go to your current location too!
